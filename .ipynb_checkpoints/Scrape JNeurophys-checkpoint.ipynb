These primate experiments demonstrate such changes, emphasizing emerging oscillatory activity patterns, and changes of the coupling between local field potentials and neuronal spiking</i>.</p></div><p><span class=\"smallcaps smallerCapital\">the signs and symptoms of</span> idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) are accompanied by altered firing of neurons in the movement-related portions of the internal pallidal segment (GPi) and other basal ganglia nuclei (as reviewed in <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B20\" id=\"B20R\">Galvan et al. 2015</a>). GPi activity has been described to be increased and abnormally patterned, with increased oscillatory and bursting activities of individual neurons, and increased synchrony between neighboring cells (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B20\" id=\"B20R\">Galvan et al. 2015</a>). One of the principal recipients of GPi output is the ventral thalamus. The specific thalamic areas that receive the movement-related basal ganglia output are known under a variety of names in different nomenclature systems. To avoid confusion, we will refer to them here as the “basal ganglia motor thalamus” (BGMT).</p><p>Studies of neuronal activity in the BGMT in animal models of parkinsonism have provided conflicting evidence with reports of either decreased neuronal firing (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B51\" id=\"B51R\">Ni et al. 2000</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B63\" id=\"B63R\">Schneider and Rothblat 1996</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B70\" id=\"B70R\">Vitek et al. 1994</a>), no change in firing rates (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B57\" id=\"B57R\">Pessiglione et al. 2005</a>), or even an increase (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B7\" id=\"B7R\">Bosch-Bouju et al. 2014</a>). In patients with idiopathic PD, neurons in the BGMT, recorded during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, have a reduced mean firing rate compared with similar recordings from non-PD patients (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B11\" id=\"B11R\">Chen et al. 2010</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B44\" id=\"B44R\">Molnar et al. 2005</a>). As in the basal ganglia, thalamic firing patterns also appear to be altered in parkinsonism, with descriptions of increased burst discharges (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B24\" id=\"B24R\">Guehl et al. 2003</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B41\" id=\"B41R\">Magnin et al. 2000</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B44\" id=\"B44R\">Molnar et al. 2005</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B57\" id=\"B57R\">Pessiglione et al. 2005</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B77\" id=\"B77R\">Zirh et al. 1998</a>) and a greater-than-normal correlation of firing of neighboring neurons (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B57\" id=\"B57R\">Pessiglione et al. 2005</a>). Few studies have evaluated local field potential (LFP) recordings in parkinsonism in the BGMT. Studies of neuronal activity in the pallidal receiving area of PD patients with drug-resistant tremor showed prominent oscillations in the tremor frequency range (4–9 Hz) in BGMT, correlated with frontal cortical oscillations (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B62\" id=\"B62R\">Sarnthein and Jeanmonod 2007</a>).</p><p>Deep brain stimulation of the GPi motor territory is a highly effective treatment for patients with advanced PD (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B48\" id=\"B48R\">Moro et al. 2010</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B59\" id=\"B59R\">Rodrigues et al. 2007</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B71\" id=\"B71R\">Weaver et al. 2005</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B76\" id=\"B76R\">Zahodne et al. 2009</a>) and is thought to reduce the impact of altered firing rates and patterns in GPi (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B29\" id=\"B29R\">Johnson et al. 2008</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B31\" id=\"B31R\">Kringelbach et al. 2007</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B35\" id=\"B35R\">Lempka and McIntyre 2013</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B61\" id=\"B61R\">Rubin et al. 2012</a>). Experimental evidence shows that high-frequency GPi microstimulation leads (at least in the short term) to entrainment of pallidal activity to the stimulation (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B6\" id=\"B6R\">Bar-Gad et al. 2004</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B12\" id=\"B12R\">Chiken and Nambu 2013</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B18\" id=\"B18R\">Erez et al. 2009</a>), and macrostimulation in parkinsonian nonhuman primates induces modest changes in pallidal firing rates, more substantial changes in oscillatory activity in the β-band of frequencies and the synchrony of firing, as well as entrainment of pallidal spiking activity to the stimulation (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B42\" id=\"B42R\">McCairn and Turner 2009</a>). Recent studies have shown that pallidal DBS reduces cortical synchronous β-band oscillations (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B30\" id=\"B30R\">Johnson et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B43\" id=\"B43R\">McCairn and Turner 2015</a>). While it is speculated that DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) may exert its antiparkinsonian effects via antidromic activation of the cerebral cortex (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B14\" id=\"B14R\">Dejean et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B16\" id=\"B16R\">Devergnas and Wichmann 2011</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B22\" id=\"B22R\">Gradinaru et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B36\" id=\"B36R\">Li et al. 2012</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B37\" id=\"B37R\">Li et al. 2007</a>), this is probably not the case for pallidal DBS (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B16\" id=\"B16R\">Devergnas and Wichmann 2011</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B43\" id=\"B43R\">McCairn and Turner 2015</a>). It is more likely that the effects of pallidal stimulation on cortical activity are orthodromically mediated via the BGMT.</p><p>The effects of electrical pallidal stimulation on thalamic activity as its immediate downstream target in the parkinsonian state remain uncertain. The impact of high-frequency stimulation of GPi on BGMT activity has previously been examined in normal animals (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B4\" id=\"B4R\">Anderson et al. 2003</a>), demonstrating predominately inhibitory effects, as well as in dystonic patients (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B45\" id=\"B45R\">Montgomery 2006</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B46\" id=\"B46R\">Montgomery and Gale 2008</a>), showing stimulation-induced alterations in the patterning of neuronal firing. Pallidal stimulation in parkinsonian monkeys was recently also shown to entrain the activity of thalamic neurons (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B1\" id=\"B1R\">Agnesi et al. 2015</a>), with strong inhibitory effects, although the stimulation in these experiments appears to have involved mostly the external pallidal segment. The present study examined in detail the effects of both parkinsonism and of GPi stimulation on BGMT activity, using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated Rhesus monkeys as a model of parkinsonism. We used stimulation parameters that mimicked those of DBS parameters in widespread clinical use.</p></div><div id=\"sec2\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i2\"></div><h1 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i2\">METHODS</h1><div id=\"sec2-1\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i3\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i3\">Animals, Surgery</h2><p>The experiments involved two juvenile male rhesus monkeys (<i>monkeys A</i> and <i>B</i>; <i>Macaca mulatta</i>; 4–6 kg). The animals were pair-housed and had ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the United States Public Health Service Policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals, including the provisions of the <i>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</i> (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B21\" id=\"B21R\">Garber et al. 2010</a>). All study protocols were submitted to, and approved by, the Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University.</p><p>The animals were first conditioned to accept handling by the experimenters and to sit in a primate chair. They then underwent aseptic surgery under isoflurane anesthesia (1–3%) for placement of two stainless steel recording chambers (inner chamber diameter 19 mm; Crist Instruments, Hagerstown, MD), positioned stereotactically and embedded, along with a stainless steel head holder and bone screws, in an acrylic “cap.” The chambers were directed at the pallidum and the thalamus on the animal's left side. The pallidal chamber was placed at a 36° angle from the vertical in the coronal plane, and the thalamic chamber was positioned at a 30° angle anterior to the vertical in the sagittal plane. The animals were allowed to recover for 1 wk after the surgery before recording and other procedures begun. Some of the bone screws were stereotaxically positioned over the occipital lobe, motor cortex, and premotor cortex of the targeted hemisphere and were connected with wires to a 9-pin connector that was also embedded in the acrylic. These screws were used to monitor EEG signals to examine wakefulness.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-2\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i4\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i4\">MPTP Treatment and Behavioral Evaluation</h2><p>After the surgical procedure, the animals were rendered progressively parkinsonian by weekly administration of small doses of MPTP (0.4–0.6 mg/kg im; total 2.8 mg/kg in one animal, divided into 6 weekly injections, and 8.2 mg/kg in the other animal, divided into 19 injections). To assess the degree and stability of the MPTP-induced motor disability, the severity of parkinsonism was assessed weekly for 15 min while the monkey was in an observation cage equipped with 8 infrared beams for activity monitoring. The sessions were also recorded with a video camera. In these sessions we scored the motor impairment in terms of 10 aspects of motor function (bradykinesia, freezing, extremity posture, trunk posture, action tremor, the frequency of arm and leg movements, finger dexterity, home cage activity, and balance). Each item was rated on a scale of zero to three (from normal to severely parkinsonian; maximal score: 30). During the time of recording, the animal scores were 19 and 20, respectively, corresponding to moderately severe parkinsonism, with prominent akinesia, bradykinesia, and balance problems. No supplemental MPTP injections were given during the time of the recording sessions.</p><p>The animals were also behaviorally scored during stimulation. For this purpose, we used a rating scale that was adapted for scoring of parkinsonism in head-restrained animals. We scored the severity of tremor and rigidity (tested through passive movements of the animal's extremities), bradykinesia, freezing, as well as body hypokinesia, each scored on a scale of zero and three (from normal to severely parkinsonian; maximal score: 15). These scores were obtained by an investigator who was unaware of the stimulation condition (no stimulation, 10-Hz stimulation, or DBS-like 120-Hz stimulation; see below for details). The stimulation lasted for 10 min, and assessments of the behavioral effects of stimulation were obtained in the time period between the 5th and 10th min of stimulation.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-3\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i5\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i5\">Electrophysiological Stimulation and Recording Methods</h2><p>Recordings were made while the animals sat in a primate chair with their head immobilized but their body and limbs free to move. The locations of the GPi and ventral thalamus were mapped by extracellular electrophysiological recording with tungsten microelectrodes (<i>Z</i> = 0.5–1.0 MΩ at 1 kHz; FHC, Bowdoinham, ME). The dura was pierced with a guide tube, and the electrode was lowered into the brain with a microdrive (MO-95B; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). The single unit signals were amplified (DAM-80 amplifier; WPI), filtered (300−6,000 Hz, model 3364 filter; Krohn-Hite, Brockton, MA), displayed on a digital oscilloscope (DPO2024; Tektronix, Beaverton, OR), and made audible via an audio amplifier and commercial speakers (Bose, Framingham, MA).</p><p>GPi neurons were identified by their location ventromedial to the external pallidal segment and by their continuous high-frequency discharge (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B15\" id=\"B15R\">DeLong 1971</a>). The sensorimotor portion of GPi was then targeted for electrical stimulation, based on its ventral and lateral position within the borders of the nucleus and the results of sensory examination of the animals during electrophysiological mapping experiments. The stimulation was carried out with bipolar concentric electrodes (SNEX-100 × 120 mm; outer diameter, 250 μm; intercontact separation, 500 μm; impedance, 25–35 kΩ; Rhodes Medical Instruments, Tujunga, CA). On each recording day, this electrode was placed into GPi for stimulation. In each animal, we positioned the electrodes to the same chamber coordinates and depth (presumably, thus, the same GPi location) on each experimental day for a series of experimental sessions. While this method of tissue stimulation is different from the use of permanently implanted DBS electrodes in patients, it had the benefit of allowing us to verify (and, if needed, to correct) the location of the tip of the electrode by electrophysiological mapping of the boundaries of the stimulated nucleus after a few weeks of usage, and did not require the permanent implantation of the electrode. We repeated the electrophysiological mapping of GPi boundaries several times during the series of recordings, and adjusted the position of the stimulation electrode (resulting in slightly separate stimulation positions in each animal, as shown in <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F2\" id=\"F2R\">Fig. 2</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). The size of the electrode and spacing of the contacts are scaled to approximate the electrode dimensions used in human DBS therapy.</p><p>Subsequent to the insertion of the stimulation electrode, recording electrodes were introduced into the thalamus through the anterior recording chamber. The recording positions were chosen relative to the anterior edge of the thalamus found in preliminary mapping experiments, which also identified the characteristic neuronal activity patterns of surrounding structures, including the STN, the zona incerta, the internal capsule, and the globus pallidus. Stimulation and recording electrodes were removed at the end of each experimental day.</p><p>The electrical signals recorded in the thalamus were stored to computer disk (sampling rate 50 kHz, Power1401 with Spike2 interface; CED, Cambridge, UK). For most neurons, the raw electrical signal potentials were also filtered between 1 Hz and 1 kHz to extract LFP signals and stored along with the neuronal spiking data.</p><p>The animals were continuously video-monitored, and all recordings were done during periods when the monkey was awake (observed in a live camera feed and by corecorded occipital EEG) and sitting still with eye movements, orofacial movements, and occasional arm movements. Each thalamic cell was first recorded at baseline, for 3–15 min. After these baseline recordings, we recorded from the same neurons during GPi stimulation with biphasic square wave pulses (120 Hz, 100 μs/phase, 200 μA). The stimuli were delivered via a constant-current stimulus isolation device (A395R; WPI, Sarasota, Florida), and timed with the D/A interface of the Power1401 unit, along with digital time stamps, and voltage signals reflecting the stimulation currents. Depending on the stability of recording, we were able to use stimulation runs of up to 948.8 s (see <span class=\"smallcaps smallerCapital\">results</span> for details). We here report on observations made during the 1st and 10th min of stimulation.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-4\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i6\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i6\">Termination of the Experiment and Histology</h2><p>After completion of the experiments, the animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg iv), followed by transcardial perfusion with oxygenated Ringer's solution, followed by 2 liters of fixative [4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2)]. The brain was blocked, cut further into 60-μm-thick sections with a vibratome, stained with cresyl violet, and immunostained for the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 and for calbindin to verify electrode positions, delineate the outlines of the BGMT, and to examine tissue damage produced by electrode insertions (<a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F1\" id=\"F1R\">Fig. 1</a>, <i>A–C</i>).

An obvious possibility of error in these studies was that remnants of stimulation artifacts were misidentified as spikes. To remove stimulation artifacts from neuronal recordings during the electrical stimulation, we used a modified version of a previously described digital averaging method (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B72\" id=\"B72R\">Wichmann 2000</a>), implemented in Spike2. For each cell, artifact templates were generated by averaging the waveforms of all stimulation artifacts. The artifacts were then scaled and subtracted from the record at the appropriate times relative to the timing of the stimuli. In recordings of eight of the thalamic cells that were studied during GPi stimulation, artifact components remained in the record even after the artifact subtraction procedure. These remaining artifact portions were replaced by brief zero-value segments, lasting an average of 0.60 ± 0.09 ms (range: 0.33–1.01 ms). For analysis of stimulation effects, similar brief zero-value segments were inserted in the baseline recordings of the neuronal spiking signals of the affected cells, so that the likelihood of detecting spikes was similarly affected during stimulation and during baseline portions of the record.</p><p>After artifact removal, the data segments were subjected to spike detection and spike sorting, using a waveform matching algorithm, followed by principal component analysis in Spike2. For each cell, distribution histograms of interspike intervals (ISIs) were constructed for an analysis of the recording quality. Spike trains containing &gt;1% of ISIs shorter than 2 ms were excluded. We then extracted information regarding the timing of spikes and stimuli from the remaining files. This information was subsequently used for extensive analyses with custom-designed algorithms in Matlab.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-5-2\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i10\"></div><h3 class=\"article-section__title\" id=\"_i10\">Assessment of basic firing characteristics.</h3><p>The possible association of changes in firing rates and patterns with parkinsonism was evaluated by comparing recordings from the pre-MPTP state with those from the MPTP-treated state. We assessed whether a cell responded to the stimulation, using data from the 1st and 10th min of stimulation, and comparing them with data from the control period immediately preceding the stimulation. We calculated firing rates (expressed as spikes/s), the coefficient of variation of ISI, as well as burst- and deceleration indexes. Calculation of the latter utilized the “surprise” method, which identifies bursts or decelerations as unexpected sequences of spiking events (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B17\" id=\"B17R\">Elias et al. 2007</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B34\" id=\"B34R\">Legendy and Salcman 1985</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B73\" id=\"B73R\">Wichmann and Soares 2006</a>). We determined the incidence of such bursts (consisting of at least 3 spikes) or decelerations, using a surprise value of 3 (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B2\" id=\"B2R\">Aldridge and Gilman 1991</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B73\" id=\"B73R\">Wichmann and Soares 2006</a>). Bursts were designated as “rebound bursts” if the immediate preburst ISI was at least two times as long as the average ISI of the respective neuron. Indexes were calculated as the proportion of spikes involved in the bursts or decelerations (relative to the total number of spikes), or the proportion of time spent by the cell in either bursts or decelerations.</p><p>We also generated “nonmodulated” data streams, i.e., ISI data from which bursts and decelerations were removed. Nonmodulated firing rates were calculated to determine whether firing rate changes were the product of, or related to, changes in bursting or decelerations, or whether the background activity of the cell changed independent of the presence of bursts or decelerations. The proportion of nonmodulated spikes and the proportion of time the cell spent in the nonmodulated state were then calculated.</p><p>A power spectral analysis to examine oscillatory properties of the neuronal discharge was carried out with the Neurospec 2.0 Matlab routines (written by Dr. David Halliday, http://www.neurospec.org, <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B25\" id=\"B25R\">Halliday et al. 1995</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B52\" id=\"B52R\">Nielsen et al. 2005</a>). For each cell, the raw spectra were generated, and integrated spectra, covering the 1- to 3-, 3- to 8-, 8- to 13-, 13- to 30-, and 30- to 100-Hz ranges were calculated. Spectra were normalized to the total power in the 1- to 100-Hz band (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B67\" id=\"B67R\">Soares et al. 2004</a>).</p></div><div id=\"sec2-5-3\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i11\"></div><h3 class=\"article-section__title\" id=\"_i11\">Analysis of interstimulus time intervals.</h3><p>We examined the temporal relationship between each neuronal spike recorded in the BGMT and the GPi stimulus that preceded it by constructing interstimulus histograms (binned in 0.2 ms intervals) and raster diagrams for each cell, plotting the period between consecutive stimuli during the 120-Hz stimulation trains. Entrainment of neuronal firing to the stimuli (if present) is easily visible in the peristimulus histograms as patterning with distinct maxima and minima, corresponding to maximal and minimal probabilities of spike occurrences during the interstimulus intervals. For each cell, the resulting interstimulus histogram values were z-scored by applying the same analysis to 250 series of shuffled ISIs (while maintaining the timing of stimuli) whose mean and SD values were then used to calculate <i>z</i>-scores. Histogram values outside of the mean ± 2 SD boundaries were considered to indicate inhibition or excitation. We examined separate interstimulus histograms for the 1st and 10th min of stimulation.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-5-4\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i12\"></div><h3 class=\"article-section__title\" id=\"_i12\">LFP analysis.</h3><p>LFP data were analyzed to study the effects of parkinsonism on LFP oscillations in the thalamus. To this end, we determined the power spectral density of the LFP data from the pre-MPTP recordings, as well as the prestimulation (control) and stimulation periods from the post-MPTP recordings. The LFP traces were first band-pass-filtered using fourth-order Butterworth zero-phase-shift filtering (1–100 Hz). The power spectral density was computed using the Welch technique, with Hamming windowing, and a fast-Fourier transform segment length of 1,024 samples with no overlap, resulting in a final spectral resolution of 0.98 Hz across the 1.95- to 99.61-Hz range. The data were normalized to the total power of the respective recording session.</p><p>We also examined whether spiking occurred at a preferred phase of the LFP oscillations. This analysis used a circular analysis as described by Lobb and colleagues (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B38\" id=\"B38R\">Lobb and Jaeger 2015</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B39\" id=\"B39R\">Lobb et al. 2013</a>). This analysis tests the ranked distribution of the Hilbert-transformed instantaneous phase of the LFP at each spike time for statistical significance using the omnibus test. For this analysis, the raw LFP data were filtered in 2-Hz-wide bands, allowing us to assess phase relationships between neuronal spiking and LFP signals with each of these bands. The data are presented as the proportion of neurons that showed a significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) phase relationship for each of the frequency bands.</p></div><div id=\"sec2-5-5\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i13\"></div><h3 class=\"article-section__title\" id=\"_i13\">Statistics and data presentation.</h3><p>The initial data preparation was carried out with Spike2 routines.

Unless indicated differently, statistical comparisons were carried out with SPSS using the Mann-Whitney test with correction for multiple comparisons for independent samples, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired <i>t</i>-tests, as appropriate, for related samples. As indicated above, the analysis of the spike/LFP phase relationship is based on the results of the Omnibus test.

The induction of parkinsonism was not accompanied by significant changes in firing rates in either of the animals, or in the pooled analysis. The firing rate was significantly reduced in segments of the data stream that did not show bursts or decelerations of discharge (nonmodulated spikes). Oscillatory firing in the 3- to 8- and 8- to 13-Hz ranges was increased, whereas oscillations in the 30- to 100-Hz (γ-) range of frequencies were decreased. There was also an overall increase of the maximal fold rate increase in bursts.

The data shown in <a class=\"primary-blue-color ref showTableEvent\" data-id=\"T2\" href=\"#T2\" id=\"T2R\">Table 2</a> demonstrate that there were no significant changes in any of the parameters tested in the analysis of pooled data from all thalamic cells (as assessed with Mann-Whitney tests). Note that the stimulation results from the 1st and 10th min of stimulation are presented separately, because each has its own set of baseline data (not all cells that were recorded for 1 min of stimulation could be recorded for the full 10-min period). The lack of changes in the group analysis is likely the result of the substantial variability of the individual baseline data and stimulation responses (see examples in <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F3\" id=\"F3R\">Fig. 3</a>). The data in <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F4\" id=\"F4R\">Fig. 4</a> were analyzed with paired tests to examine changes within the 1st and 10th min of recording (as a proportion of the respective cell's baseline). We found that GPi stimulation increased the average firing rate (but not significantly, <i>P</i> = 0.877 in the 1st min and <i>P</i> = 0.964 in the 10th min of stimulation), and decreased 1- to 3-Hz oscillatory spiking (<i>P</i> = 0.000 for the 1st and 10th min of stimulation), as well as 13- to 30-Hz oscillations (<i>P</i> = 0.007 for the 1st min of stimulation). There were no significant overall changes in the parameters describing bursting, or in other oscillatory frequency ranges (compared with the respective recordings from unstimulated controls). The comparison between the 1st and 10th min of stimulation did not indicate significant changes in these parameters during the stimulation.</p><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"T2\"></div><div

Cells recorded after MPTP exposure fired at a lower nonmodulated rate and showed more intense rebound bursting. There were also changes in the oscillatory firing properties of BGMT neurons, with an increase in the 3- to 13-Hz range of oscillations and a reduction in the 30- to 100-Hz range. LFP signals, recorded at the same time as the spike discharges, showed an increase in low-frequency spectral power (with a peak in the 10- to 15-Hz range) and a reduction in the 30- to 100-Hz range. The coupling between LFP signals and neuronal spiking was strongly increased throughout most of the 1- to 100-Hz spectral range.</p><p>Stimulation at 120 Hz had antiparkinsonian effects along with variable changes in the firing rates of BGMT neurons (with increases or decreases in firing, as shown in <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F3\" id=\"F3R\">Fig. 3</a>). In the aggregate, these changes did not reach significance. We also saw a reduction of low-frequency neuronal oscillatory activity. The coupling between neuronal spikes and LFP activity was substantially reduced by the stimulation. In distinction from studies in the basal ganglia, we found little direct entrainment between the stimulation and thalamic spike patterns.</p><div id=\"sec4-1\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i28\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i28\">MPTP-Induced Changes in Firing</h2><p>The literature on MPTP-induced changes in the firing of neurons in the basal-ganglia-receiving portion of the thalamus differs considerably, ranging from reports of reduced spontaneous firing (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B51\" id=\"B51R\">Ni et al. 2000</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B63\" id=\"B63R\">Schneider and Rothblat 1996</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B70\" id=\"B70R\">Vitek et al. 1994</a>) to no change (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B57\" id=\"B57R\">Pessiglione et al. 2005</a>) or even increased firing (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B7\" id=\"B7R\">Bosch-Bouju et al. 2014</a>). Our results indicate that MPTP lowered the firing rates of thalamic neurons in these animals, consistent with the hypothesis that inhibitory basal ganglia output to the thalamus is generally increased in the parkinsonian state. The differences between this and some of the other studies may have been caused by the use of different animal species or may have occurred because of differences in the state of arousal of the animals, which is well known to strongly influence thalamic firing, specifically the generation of burst firing (see review by <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B13\" id=\"B13R\">Crunelli et al. 2015</a>). We paid careful attention to keep the animals awake during the recording sessions, using video and EEG observations to monitor the animal's state of wakefulness, and examined whether the remaining presence of bursts or decelerations in firing strongly altered firing rates in our sample, by removing th ose ISIs from the analysis that were engaged in bursts or decelerations. In our animals, firing rates were lower in these nonmodulated data streams in the parkinsonian state.</p><p>Burst discharges in the thalamus were more common in general, particularly with regard to rebound bursts (defined as bursts that were preceded by pauses in firing). In absolute terms, the average intraburst frequency, or the length of bursts, did not change, but the bursts occurred on the background of a reduced average firing rate, so that the relative increase in firing rates in bursts was much higher in the parkinsonian than in the normal state.</p><p>The spectral distribution of spikes changed in the parkinsonian state, with an increase in the 3- to 8- and 8- to 13-Hz spectral ranges, and a reduction in the 30- to 100-Hz (γ-) range. These differences reflect those seen previously in basal ganglia recordings (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B20\" id=\"B20R\">Galvan et al. 2015</a>), as well as in those from subgroups of cortical neurons (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B54\" id=\"B54R\">Pasquereau and Turner 2013</a>, <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B55\" id=\"B55R\">2011</a>). Unlike what has been described for neurons in the basal ganglia (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B6\" id=\"B6R\">Bar-Gad et al. 2004</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B27\" id=\"B27R\">Hashimoto et al. 2003</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B42\" id=\"B42R\">McCairn and Turner 2009</a>), the spectral power was increased in broad ranges of frequencies rather than distinct spectral peaks.</p><p>LFPs are strongly influenced by the size and synchrony of synaptic potentials, triggered by afferent inputs (see, e.g., <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B10\" id=\"B10R\">Buzsaki et al. 2012</a>). As shown in <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F6\" id=\"F6R\">Fig. 6<i>A</i></a>, the spectral distribution, normalized to the total power in the 2- to 100-Hz range, changed significantly, with increased power at low frequencies (below 20 Hz) and reduced spectral power in the γ-range. These findings are, of course, not surprising, since they likely reflect similar network changes in the basal ganglia and at the cortical level and correspond to frequency band modulation in human parkinsonism and DBS (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B8\" id=\"B8R\">Brittain et al. 2014</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B68\" id=\"B68R\">Swann et al. 2015</a>).</p></div><div id=\"sec4-2\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i29\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i29\">Stimulation-Induced Changes in the Basal Ganglia-Receiving Territory</h2><p>In the first study of the effects of electrical stimulation of the GPi on neuronal discharge in the thalamus, Anderson and colleagues (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B4\" id=\"B4R\">Anderson et al. 2003</a>) reported that thalamic firing rates were in many cells reduced upon GPi stimulation, easily explained by the possibility that pallidal output to the thalamus was stimulated. By contrast, we observed that high-frequency stimulation did not consistently change thalamic firing rates, but induced effects that differed substantially from cell to cell. The reasons for the differences between our study and the previously published results remain unclear, but could relate to experimental differences, perhaps most importantly the fact that our studies were done in the parkinsonian state while those by Anderson et al. were done in normal monkeys. The greater pallidal output in parkinsonism may hyperpolarize thalamic neurons, so that further increase in pallidal output through electrical stimulation may be sufficient to lower the membrane potential of thalamic neurons enough to render them prone to rebound burst discharges.</p><p>While the effects on firing rates reversed some of the abnormalities that were seen in the parkinsonian state, it is clear that the stimulation did not reverse all of the “parkinsonian” abnormalities, concomitant with a relevant but incomplete reduction of parkinsonian clinical signs. This was particularly obvious for the oscillatory discharge patterns, where the stimulation resulted in a strong reduction of 1- to 3-Hz oscillation, but much smaller (or no) changes in the 13- to 30- (β) and 30- to 100- (γ) Hz ranges. β- And γ-range oscillations in the basal ganglia have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B9\" id=\"B9R\">Brown et al. 2001</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B20\" id=\"B20R\">Galvan et al. 2015</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B26\" id=\"B26R\">Hammond et al. 2007</a>), and were previously shown to respond to electrical basal ganglia stimulation (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B19\" id=\"B19R\">Eusebio et al. 2011</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B32\" id=\"B32R\">Kuhn et al. 2008</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B58\" id=\"B58R\">Quinn et al. 2015</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B60\" id=\"B60R\">Rosa et al. 2011</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B75\" id=\"B75R\">Wingeier et al. 2006</a>). The observed differences between the oscillatory activity in neuronal spiking activity in the basal ganglia and in the thalamus suggest that oscillations at these frequencies are not simply “transmitted” from the basal ganglia to the thalamus, and from there on to the cerebral cortex.</p><p>Stimulation of the STN results in obvious entrainment of pallidal neurons in primates (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B1\" id=\"B1R\">Agnesi et al. 2015</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B6\" id=\"B6R\">Bar-Gad et al. 2004</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B18\" id=\"B18R\">Erez et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B27\" id=\"B27R\">Hashimoto et al. 2003</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B30\" id=\"B30R\">Johnson et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B40\" id=\"B40R\">Ma et al. 2007</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B42\" id=\"B42R\">McCairn and Turner 2009</a>). It has therefore been widely expected that stimulation of the basal ganglia “motor” output nucleus GPi would similarly entrain thalamic neurons. However, while our study shows that some thalamic neurons are entrained to the GPi stimulation (see also <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B1\" id=\"B1R\">Agnesi et al. 2015</a>), we found that the level of entrainment is much smaller than that reported in the basal ganglia, adding further evidence to the notion that the effects of electrical basal ganglia stimulation are not a simple driving or frequency band propagation of thalamic cells (see, e.g., <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B50\" id=\"B50R\">Neuenschwander et al. 2002</a>). The difference between the entrainment in GPi after STN stimulation and the lack of entrainment of thalamic cells after GPi stimulation may be caused by the difference in the kinetics of synaptic interactions between the glutamatergic STN-GPi interaction and the GABAergic GPi-thalamic interaction (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B3\" id=\"B3R\">Alexander et al. 2006</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B53\" id=\"B53R\">Park et al. 2014</a>). The electrical high-frequency stimulation of the pallidum may induce a tonic change of polarization of thalamic neurons, especially after episodes of extended stimulation.</p><p>We found that the spectral power of LFPs recorded in the BGMT in the α- and β-ranges was increased, with a peak of oscillatory power in the β-band range in the parkinsonian state, and that the spectral power in the γ-band was reduced. We also found the spiking activity of more neurons to be coupled to the phase of concomitantly recorded LFPs in the parkinsonian than in the normal state across the entire range of frequencies studied. <a class=\"primary-blue-color\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-Figures\" href=\"#F6\" id=\"F6R\">Figure 6</a> demonstrates that the stimulation reduced the coupling between spikes and LFP signals while not significantly altering the power spectra of LFPs. This apparent stimulation-induced uncoupling of thalamic spiking and LFPs would support the notion that the stimulation disrupts the synchrony between neurons. On the basis of neural modeling and other evidence, it has been previously suggested that desynchronization may, in fact, be a fundamental effect of DBS (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B74\" id=\"B74R\">Wilson et al. 2011</a>), and experimental studies in primates have shown such decoupling effects to occur in the basal ganglia (e.g., <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B47\" id=\"B47R\">Moran et al. 2012</a>). Our results demonstrate that similar uncoupling may also affect BGMT activity.</p></div><div id=\"sec4-3\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i30\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i30\">Limitations</h2><p>The current study is limited by the number of cells recorded in the different behavioral states. The number of cells that could be analyzed for this report was limited because we chose cells with very good to excellent signal-to-noise ratio that were clearly within the basal ganglia-related territory of the thalamus. It would also have been preferable to have more animals available for this analysis.</p><p>We acutely inserted high-impedance electrodes to record both single neuron potentials as well as LFPs. While this optimized the conditions for single-neuron recording, this approach limits LFP recording fidelity due to inherent hardware filter characteristics of the electrodes (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B49\" id=\"B49R\">Nelson et al. 2008</a>). A specific potential problem is that the insertion and recording of potentials at different locations in the thalamus do not allow us to adequately compare absolute LFP amplitudes before and after the induction of parkinsonism.</p><p>Stimulation occurred for several minutes instead of the time scale one would use in human PD patients that measures in months and years. While this may account for differences between the MPTP stimulation model and PD patients, it should be noted that the antiparkinsonian effects of DBS become observable within seconds of activation in human patients with PD (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B28\" id=\"B28R\">Hristova et al. 2000</a>), although gradual changes with much slower time constants also occur (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B5\" id=\"B5R\">Angeli et al. 2015</a>). Most LFP recordings in human studies are based on perioperative recordings with similar short time scales as chosen for the present study. Therefore, the 10-min stimulation cycles used here may be considered sufficient indicators of thalamic activity during DBS on a short (ms to s)- and intermediate (min)-term scale.</p><p>This study was performed in the animals' resting state with explorative eye movements, orofacial movements, and occasional arm movements. While the corticothalamic information flow probably does not completely cease under such “resting state” conditions, it likely differs from that activated when the animal is purposefully moving. For instance, functional imaging studies in humans have discovered a cortical “default mode” network that is active during physical and mental inactivity in awake attentive individuals who are not engaged in a challenging task (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B23\" id=\"B23R\">Greicius and Menon 2004</a>). This network differs from that seen during performance of challenging tasks (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B69\" id=\"B69R\">van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol 2010</a>). Parkinsonian signs such as bradykinesia are mostly (or only) apparent during active movement. It is therefore possible that more and different abnormalities in thalamic processing in the parkinsonian state would have been apparent in more activated states. Likewise, stimulation effects on thalamic processing in the active state may differ from their effects in the resting state that was studied here. Specific questions about the relevance of disturbances of thalamic information transmission for active behavior in the parkinsonian state, or about the specific contribution of thalamic transmission to parkinsonian bradykinesia or tremor, remain to be examined in future studies involving recordings during active movements.</p><p>Finally, related to the previous point, it is worth mentioning that the effects of stimulation with a stimulation electrode in the GPi are not specific for any one basal ganglia output pathway. Stimulation with long trains of stimuli, as used here (and in DBS therapy), is likely to engage pathways other than the direct pallidothalamic connection. For instance, the stimulation may also have engaged the GPi projection to the caudal intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus [the centromedian and parafascicular nucleus (<a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B64\" id=\"B64R\">Smith et al. 2014</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B65\" id=\"B65R\">Smith et al. 2009</a>; <a class=\"primary-blue-color tab-link\" data-tab=\"pane-pcw-references\" href=\"#B66\" id=\"B66R\">Smith et al. 2004</a>)], affecting the animal's state of arousal, which, as mentioned before, may then have altered thalamic firing. While we limited our recordings to epochs of wakefulness, it is possible that small shifts in arousal contributed to the results shown here. Effects on other networks, for instance, involving cortico-cortical connections or connections between GPi and the pedunculopontine nucleus of the brain stem, can also not be excluded.</p><p>Most of the mentioned limitations are not specific to this study but apply to any study of electrophysiological effects of DBS-like stimulation.</p></div><div id=\"sec4-4\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i31\"></div><h2 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i31\">Conclusions</h2><p>In conclusion, antiparkinsonian high-frequency stimulation of the GPi ameliorated some of the thalamic firing abnormalities that were associated with parkinsonism, and resulted in an uncoupling of spiking activity from LFP activity in the thalamus, which may reflect a desynchronizing property of GPi stimulation. Future studies need to examine whether similar changes also apply during episodes of thalamic activation during learned motor tasks, and whether neighboring cells in the thalamus truly change their synchronization state.</p></div></div><div id=\"sec5\"><div class=\"anchor-spacer\" id=\"_i32\"></div><h1 class=\"article-section__title section__title\" id=\"_i32\">GRANTS</h1><p>This project was supported through <funding-source id=\"gs1\">National Institutes of Health</funding-source> Grants <award-id rid=\"gs1\">P50-NS-071669</award-id> (Udall Center grant) and <award-id rid=\"gs1\">P51-OD-11132</award-id> (Yerkes Center infrastructure grant).

       "\"MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals.This study used male Sprague-Dawley rats ranging from 300 to 500 g. All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by Penn State's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Surgeries.Each rat was injected intramuscularly (IM) with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg). Subsequently, IM injections of atropine methyl nitrate (0.05 mg/kg), dexamethasone sodium phosphate (5 mg/kg), and enrofloxacin (2.5 mg/kg) were administered before the rat was intubated through the oral cavity and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a homeothermic heating blanket, and vital signs (i.e., heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and end-tidal CO2) were monitored continuously. After the scalp was infiltrated with multiple injections of bupivicaine, a midline incision exposed the cranial surface. A machine screw inserted in the cranium over the cerebellum served as a ground lead, and a second screw inserted over the left frontal cortex enabled electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings. A craniotomy over the posterior thalamus and midbrain provided access to the Pf, POm, or superior colliculus for neuronal recordings and tracer injections. Stereotaxic coordinates for the craniotomies were measured with respect to bregma: 1.2 mm lateral and 4.1 mm caudal for Pf, 2.6 mm lateral and 3.8 mm caudal for the posterior POm, and 2.0 mm lateral and 6.5 mm caudal for the superior colliculus.Dental cement was applied over the screws inserted in the occipital ridge, and two inverted bolts were inserted into the cement. After the cement cured, a goose-neck manipulator was fastened to each bolt. Stereotaxic ear bars were then removed to eliminate nociceptive inputs from the soft tissue in the auditory meatus.A SciWorks data acquisition system (version 6.0; DataWave Technologies, Broomfield, CO) displayed ECoG recordings continuously to indicate the anesthetic state of the rat (Friedberg et al. 1999). Electrical potentials at the dural surface of the frontal cortex were amplified, filtered (0.3–300 Hz), and sampled at 256 Hz using an analog-to-digital board (DT2839; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA). A color-coded fast-Fourier transform of the ECoG activity was displayed and updated once per second to visualize changes in cortical frequencies. Power spectra dominated by 1–2 Hz occurred during deep anesthesia when rats were unresponsive to noxious stimuli, but as the ketamine and xylazine were metabolized, the power spectra gradually shifted to 5–6 Hz, which indicates a lightly anesthetized state (Friedberg et al. 1999). To prevent wakefulness, the rat was maintained in an unconscious state by ventilation with isoflurane through the endotracheal tube. Isoflurane concentration was gradually increased over 2–3 h until it reached 0.75–1.0%, which was sufficient to maintain the rat in a constant anesthetic plane in which ECoG activity was dominated by frequencies of 5–6 Hz for the remainder of the experiment. Isoflurane produces dose-dependent suppression of thalamocortical transmission, but the concentrations used in this study were below the levels that prevent stimulus-induced responses in the thalamus (Detsch et al. 1999, 2002).Tracer injections.All tracers were iontophoretically injected from solutions in glass pipettes with tip diameters of 20–25 μm. A 2% solution of Fluoro-Gold (FG) in saline was used to produce retrograde labeling; a 15% solution of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to produce anterograde labeling. In some cases, we injected a combined solution of FG and BDA to reveal anterograde and retrograde connections from the same injection site. All tracer injections were made by using vertically oriented pipettes at the following depths below the cortical surface: 5.0–5.4 mm ventral for Pf, 4.5–5.6 mm ventral for POm, and 4.5–5.5 mm ventral for the superior colliculus. Before the target depth was reached, a retention current (−5 μA) was applied to the tracer solution to prevent tracer leakage.After the target was reached, the retention current was turned off. The silver wire used to conduct the retention current was then connected to the head stage of an extracellular amplifier (Dagan 2200; Minneapolis, MN) to record neuronal discharges in response to whisker deflections (see Neurophysiology recordings). This technique verified that tracers were injected at whisker-sensitive sites in Pf, POm, and the superior colliculus. The tracer-filled pipette was slowly advanced while the contralateral whiskers were repetitively deflected by a computer-controlled stimulator (see Whisker stimulation). When whisker-sensitive neurons were encountered, their responses were recorded during computer-controlled whisker stimulation. We also used a hand-held light-emitting diode to test whether visual stimulation evoked neuronal responses in Pf or POm. Subsequently, the tracer was iontophoretically ejected by applying positive current pulses in 7-s on-off intervals. For FG deposits, current (2 μA) pulses were applied for 30 min; for BDA deposits, current (2–5 μA) pulses were applied for 20–40 min. When both tracers were in the pipette solution, current was applied as 3-μA pulses for 20–30 min.Histochemistry.After a transport period of 7–10 days, injected rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (18 mg/kg) and were transcardially perfused with physiological saline containing 1% heparin, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10% sucrose. After the brain was removed from each animal's head, the olfactory bulbs, cerebellum, and caudal brain stem were sliced off and the rest of the brain was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde with 30% sucrose. A shallow slit in the ventral surface of the left hemisphere provided a fiduciary mark for mounting sections in the correct left-right orientation. A freezing microtome was used to slice coronal sections at a thickness of 60 μm.For brains that received FG deposits, alternate serially ordered sections were mounted on gel-coated glass slides and dried overnight. Cytoarchitecture was revealed in one series either by staining the sections with thionin or by processing them for the presence of cytochrome oxidase (Land and Simons 1985; Wong-Riley 1979). The other series was processed for FG labeling by dehydrating the sections in ethanol, defatting them in xylene, and coverslipping them with Cytoseal.For brains that received BDA deposits, brain sections were divided into three series. One was stained with thionin or processed for cytochrome oxidase to visualize neural structures. The second series was processed for BDA as described before (Alloway et al. 1998; Kincaid and Wilson 1996; Smith et al. 2012), and the third series was either processed for FG or served as a backup for BDA if necessary. To visualize BDA labeling, sections were agitated in 0.3% H2O2 to reduce background enzymes and then placed in 0.1 M PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) before they were incubated for 2–4 h in an avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase solution (Vector Novocastra Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After the sections were rinsed with PBS, the tracer was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.005% H2O2, 0.04% NiCl2, and 0.04% CoCl2 in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.2) for 9–12 min. The reaction was stopped by subsequent washes in PBS, and the processed sections were mounted on gel-coated slides.Anatomic analysis.The BDA injections and BDA-labeled terminals were examined with an Olympus BH-2 microscope. Locations of BDA-labeled axon varicosities, which represent en passant synapses (Kincaid and Wilson 1996; Meng et al. 2004; Voight et al. 1993), were plotted and digitally reconstructed with respect to neighboring anatomic landmarks by using an AccuStage microscopic reconstruction system (St. Paul, MN) as described previously (Alloway et al. 2009). Sections that contained FG-labeled neurons were visualized by means of a UV filter (110000v2; Chroma Technology, Bellows Fall, VT). Only FG-labeled neurons that displayed one or more dendrites were plotted and reconstructed with respect to surrounding landmarks. Photomicrographs of tracer injections were acquired using a Retiga EX charge-coupled device digital camera (Q-imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) mounted on the microscope.The tissue volumes infiltrated by BDA injections were estimated using the AccuStage reconstruction system. Outlines of the tracer injections were drawn on the plotted reconstructions, and an AccuStage module was used to measure the area enclosed within the outline. Because BDA injections appeared only in sections processed for BDA, tracer diffusion in the intervening sections was estimated by interpolating the areas measured on adjacent sections that had been processed for BDA. Section areas of all tracer injections, both measured and estimated by interpolation, were summed and multiplied by section thickness to estimate the volume of thalamic tissue that was infiltrated by the BDA tracer injection.The volume of the striatal neuropil innervated by labeled projections was calculated using a procedure similar to the one for estimating tracer injection volumes in the thalamus. Each reconstructed section of the plotted BDA-labeled varicosities was subdivided into 25-μm square bins. The number of square bins containing two or more plotted varicosities was summed and multiplied by 25 μm2 to estimate the area of terminal labeling in each coronal section. Interpolation was used to estimate the area of terminal BDA-labeling in the intervening sections that were not processed for BDA. For each rat, sectional areas of the striatal labeling, either measured or estimated by interpolation, were summed and multiplied by section thickness to estimate the total striatal volume that was innervated by the injection site in Pf or POm.The density of plotted varicosities in the striatum was calculated from the reconstructed sections. The total number of 25-μm square bins containing plotted varicosities was summed across all sections reconstructed for each animal, and then this area was divided by the total number of varicosities that had been plotted for that case. Density was then expressed as the number of plotted varicosities per square millimeter.Neurophysiology recordings.Tracer-filled pipettes having impedances of 0.5 MΩ were used to record whisker-evoked responses in the thalamus and superior colliculus before tracer injection. Extracellular discharges were visualized on a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO4034; Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) while neuronal responses were listened to on an acoustic speaker. Trial-based responses were stored on hard disk and were replayed off-line to sort the waveforms according to their amplitude, width, and other characteristics. Biphasic discharges were plainly evident in waveforms recorded by tracer-filled pipettes, but the discharges were usually not as well isolated as waveforms recorded by higher impedance electrodes.The depth of anesthesia was generally greater in the tracer injection experiments, and given that neuronal isolation was not optimal in tracer-filled pipettes, comparisons of response properties in Pf and POm were analyzed in separate experiments using saline-filled pipettes that had impedances of 1–1.5 MΩ and recorded well-isolated discharges. In some experiments, only one electrode was inserted into the thalamus to record whisker-sensitive neurons in Pf or POm. In most experiments, two electrodes were inserted so that POm and Pf were recorded simultaneously by electrodes that could be moved independently. In these latter cases, the POm was recorded by an electrode that entered the brain 5.2 mm lateral and 3.6 mm caudal to bregma, at 33° from vertical. Discharges with a signal-to-noise ratio of a least 3:1 were time-stamped at a resolution of 0.1 ms and were displayed as peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). After the mean rate of spontaneous activity was measured, 99% confidence limits were displayed on each PSTH, and whisker-evoked responses were considered significant if they exceeded the confidence limits for two or more contiguous bins. Based on PSTHs constructed with 1-ms bins, response latencies were measured from the time of stimulus onset to the time of two contiguous bins in which both exceeded the 99% confidence limit. Current was passed through the recording pipettes (5 mA for >30 s) to produce electrolytic lesions that marked the recording sites in the histological sections.Whisker stimulation.Multiple vibrissae (rows B–E, arcs 1–5) were stimulated in tandem by computer-controlled movements of a galvanometer obtained from a Grass polygraph. As done previously (Mowery et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2012; Zhang and Alloway 2004), a small piece of window screen was attached to the tip of the galvanometer's ink pen, and this was positioned so that the whiskers, clipped to a length of 20 mm, protruded through the screen openings by 8–12 mm. Timed output from a digital waveform generator (ArbStudio; LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY) was used to control galvanometer movements. Each trial contained a sequence of twelve 50-ms triangular stimuli so that blocks of four stimuli were presented at a rate of 2, 5, and 8 Hz. The first stimulus in each block of four was classified as ≤1 Hz (i.e., less than or equal to 1 Hz) because it was preceded by an interval of 1 s or more in which no stimulus was administered. For each 50-ms stimulus, the whiskers were initially deflected in the caudal direction (∼1.5 mm) during the first 25-ms period, and then they returned to the original resting position over the next 25-ms period. In this context, substantial evidence indicates that the DLS mediates some aspects of exploratory whisking, which is an innate behavior in rats and other rodents. The DLS receives dense inputs from somatosensory (SI) barrel cortex (Alloway et al. 1999, 2006; Brown et al. 1998), and DLS neurons discharge rhythmically during exploratory whisking (Carelli and West 1991). Like other DLS-linked behaviors, whisking does not depend on a rewarded outcome but occurs automatically (Moreno et al. 2010; Welker 1964). Free-air whisking is characterized by frequency-specific epochs of whisking sequences that are replaced by stereotyped patterns of whisker movements when a rat encounters a novel object (Mitchinson et al. 2007; Sachdev et al. 2003; Towal and Hartmann 2006). Furthermore, even though whisking is an innate behavior, it can be modified by instrumental conditioning procedures that have been used to establish S-R associations in the DLS (Gao et al. 2003; Mermejo et al. 1996).\""

       "{'MATERIALS AND METHODS': \"Animals.This study used male Sprague-Dawley rats ranging from 300 to 500 g. All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by Penn State's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Surgeries.Each rat was injected intramuscularly (IM) with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg). Subsequently, IM injections of atropine methyl nitrate (0.05 mg/kg), dexamethasone sodium phosphate (5 mg/kg), and enrofloxacin (2.5 mg/kg) were administered before the rat was intubated through the oral cavity and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a homeothermic heating blanket, and vital signs (i.e., heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and end-tidal CO2) were monitored continuously. After the scalp was infiltrated with multiple injections of bupivicaine, a midline incision exposed the cranial surface. A machine screw inserted in the cranium over the cerebellum served as a ground lead, and a second screw inserted over the left frontal cortex enabled electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings. A craniotomy over the posterior thalamus and midbrain provided access to the Pf, POm, or superior colliculus for neuronal recordings and tracer injections. Stereotaxic coordinates for the craniotomies were measured with respect to bregma: 1.2 mm lateral and 4.1 mm caudal for Pf, 2.6 mm lateral and 3.8 mm caudal for the posterior POm, and 2.0 mm lateral and 6.5 mm caudal for the superior colliculus.Dental cement was applied over the screws inserted in the occipital ridge, and two inverted bolts were inserted into the cement. After the cement cured, a goose-neck manipulator was fastened to each bolt. Stereotaxic ear bars were then removed to eliminate nociceptive inputs from the soft tissue in the auditory meatus.A SciWorks data acquisition system (version 6.0; DataWave Technologies, Broomfield, CO) displayed ECoG recordings continuously to indicate the anesthetic state of the rat (Friedberg et al. 1999). Electrical potentials at the dural surface of the frontal cortex were amplified, filtered (0.3–300 Hz), and sampled at 256 Hz using an analog-to-digital board (DT2839; Data Translation, Marlboro, MA). A color-coded fast-Fourier transform of the ECoG activity was displayed and updated once per second to visualize changes in cortical frequencies. Power spectra dominated by 1–2 Hz occurred during deep anesthesia when rats were unresponsive to noxious stimuli, but as the ketamine and xylazine were metabolized, the power spectra gradually shifted to 5–6 Hz, which indicates a lightly anesthetized state (Friedberg et al. 1999). To prevent wakefulness, the rat was maintained in an unconscious state by ventilation with isoflurane through the endotracheal tube. Isoflurane concentration was gradually increased over 2–3 h until it reached 0.75–1.0%, which was sufficient to maintain the rat in a constant anesthetic plane in which ECoG activity was dominated by frequencies of 5–6 Hz for the remainder of the experiment. Isoflurane produces dose-dependent suppression of thalamocortical transmission, but the concentrations used in this study were below the levels that prevent stimulus-induced responses in the thalamus (Detsch et al. 1999, 2002).Tracer injections.All tracers were iontophoretically injected from solutions in glass pipettes with tip diameters of 20–25 μm. A 2% solution of Fluoro-Gold (FG) in saline was used to produce retrograde labeling; a 15% solution of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to produce anterograde labeling. In some cases, we injected a combined solution of FG and BDA to reveal anterograde and retrograde connections from the same injection site. All tracer injections were made by using vertically oriented pipettes at the following depths below the cortical surface: 5.0–5.4 mm ventral for Pf, 4.5–5.6 mm ventral for POm, and 4.5–5.5 mm ventral for the superior colliculus. Before the target depth was reached, a retention current (−5 μA) was applied to the tracer solution to prevent tracer leakage.After the target was reached, the retention current was turned off. The silver wire used to conduct the retention current was then connected to the head stage of an extracellular amplifier (Dagan 2200; Minneapolis, MN) to record neuronal discharges in response to whisker deflections (see Neurophysiology recordings). This technique verified that tracers were injected at whisker-sensitive sites in Pf, POm, and the superior colliculus. The tracer-filled pipette was slowly advanced while the contralateral whiskers were repetitively deflected by a computer-controlled stimulator (see Whisker stimulation). When whisker-sensitive neurons were encountered, their responses were recorded during computer-controlled whisker stimulation. We also used a hand-held light-emitting diode to test whether visual stimulation evoked neuronal responses in Pf or POm. Subsequently, the tracer was iontophoretically ejected by applying positive current pulses in 7-s on-off intervals. For FG deposits, current (2 μA) pulses were applied for 30 min; for BDA deposits, current (2–5 μA) pulses were applied for 20–40 min. When both tracers were in the pipette solution, current was applied as 3-μA pulses for 20–30 min.Histochemistry.After a transport period of 7–10 days, injected rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (18 mg/kg) and were transcardially perfused with physiological saline containing 1% heparin, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and 4% paraformaldehyde containing 10% sucrose. After the brain was removed from each animal's head, the olfactory bulbs, cerebellum, and caudal brain stem were sliced off and the rest of the brain was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde with 30% sucrose. A shallow slit in the ventral surface of the left hemisphere provided a fiduciary mark for mounting sections in the correct left-right orientation. A freezing microtome was used to slice coronal sections at a thickness of 60 μm.For brains that received FG deposits, alternate serially ordered sections were mounted on gel-coated glass slides and dried overnight. Cytoarchitecture was revealed in one series either by staining the sections with thionin or by processing them for the presence of cytochrome oxidase (Land and Simons 1985; Wong-Riley 1979). The other series was processed for FG labeling by dehydrating the sections in ethanol, defatting them in xylene, and coverslipping them with Cytoseal.For brains that received BDA deposits, brain sections were divided into three series. One was stained with thionin or processed for cytochrome oxidase to visualize neural structures. The second series was processed for BDA as described before (Alloway et al. 1998; Kincaid and Wilson 1996; Smith et al. 2012), and the third series was either processed for FG or served as a backup for BDA if necessary. To visualize BDA labeling, sections were agitated in 0.3% H2O2 to reduce background enzymes and then placed in 0.1 M PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4) before they were incubated for 2–4 h in an avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase solution (Vector Novocastra Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After the sections were rinsed with PBS, the tracer was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.005% H2O2, 0.04% NiCl2, and 0.04% CoCl2 in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.2) for 9–12 min. The reaction was stopped by subsequent washes in PBS, and the processed sections were mounted on gel-coated slides.Anatomic analysis.The BDA injections and BDA-labeled terminals were examined with an Olympus BH-2 microscope. Locations of BDA-labeled axon varicosities, which represent en passant synapses (Kincaid and Wilson 1996; Meng et al. 2004; Voight et al. 1993), were plotted and digitally reconstructed with respect to neighboring anatomic landmarks by using an AccuStage microscopic reconstruction system (St. Paul, MN) as described previously (Alloway et al. 2009). Sections that contained FG-labeled neurons were visualized by means of a UV filter (110000v2; Chroma Technology, Bellows Fall, VT). Only FG-labeled neurons that displayed one or more dendrites were plotted and reconstructed with respect to surrounding landmarks. Photomicrographs of tracer injections were acquired using a Retiga EX charge-coupled device digital camera (Q-imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) mounted on the microscope.The tissue volumes infiltrated by BDA injections were estimated using the AccuStage reconstruction system. Outlines of the tracer injections were drawn on the plotted reconstructions, and an AccuStage module was used to measure the area enclosed within the outline. Because BDA injections appeared only in sections processed for BDA, tracer diffusion in the intervening sections was estimated by interpolating the areas measured on adjacent sections that had been processed for BDA. Section areas of all tracer injections, both measured and estimated by interpolation, were summed and multiplied by section thickness to estimate the volume of thalamic tissue that was infiltrated by the BDA tracer injection.The volume of the striatal neuropil innervated by labeled projections was calculated using a procedure similar to the one for estimating tracer injection volumes in the thalamus. Each reconstructed section of the plotted BDA-labeled varicosities was subdivided into 25-μm square bins. The number of square bins containing two or more plotted varicosities was summed and multiplied by 25 μm2 to estimate the area of terminal labeling in each coronal section. Interpolation was used to estimate the area of terminal BDA-labeling in the intervening sections that were not processed for BDA. For each rat, sectional areas of the striatal labeling, either measured or estimated by interpolation, were summed and multiplied by section thickness to estimate the total striatal volume that was innervated by the injection site in Pf or POm.The density of plotted varicosities in the striatum was calculated from the reconstructed sections. The total number of 25-μm square bins containing plotted varicosities was summed across all sections reconstructed for each animal, and then this area was divided by the total number of varicosities that had been plotted for that case. Density was then expressed as the number of plotted varicosities per square millimeter.Neurophysiology recordings.Tracer-filled pipettes having impedances of 0.5 MΩ were used to record whisker-evoked responses in the thalamus and superior colliculus before tracer injection. Extracellular discharges were visualized on a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO4034; Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) while neuronal responses were listened to on an acoustic speaker. Trial-based responses were stored on hard disk and were replayed off-line to sort the waveforms according to their amplitude, width, and other characteristics. Biphasic discharges were plainly evident in waveforms recorded by tracer-filled pipettes, but the discharges were usually not as well isolated as waveforms recorded by higher impedance electrodes.The depth of anesthesia was generally greater in the tracer injection experiments, and given that neuronal isolation was not optimal in tracer-filled pipettes, comparisons of response properties in Pf and POm were analyzed in separate experiments using saline-filled pipettes that had impedances of 1–1.5 MΩ and recorded well-isolated discharges. In some experiments, only one electrode was inserted into the thalamus to record whisker-sensitive neurons in Pf or POm. In most experiments, two electrodes were inserted so that POm and Pf were recorded simultaneously by electrodes that could be moved independently. In these latter cases, the POm was recorded by an electrode that entered the brain 5.2 mm lateral and 3.6 mm caudal to bregma, at 33° from vertical. Discharges with a signal-to-noise ratio of a least 3:1 were time-stamped at a resolution of 0.1 ms and were displayed as peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). After the mean rate of spontaneous activity was measured, 99% confidence limits were displayed on each PSTH, and whisker-evoked responses were considered significant if they exceeded the confidence limits for two or more contiguous bins. Based on PSTHs constructed with 1-ms bins, response latencies were measured from the time of stimulus onset to the time of two contiguous bins in which both exceeded the 99% confidence limit. Current was passed through the recording pipettes (5 mA for >30 s) to produce electrolytic lesions that marked the recording sites in the histological sections.Whisker stimulation.Multiple vibrissae (rows B–E, arcs 1–5) were stimulated in tandem by computer-controlled movements of a galvanometer obtained from a Grass polygraph. As done previously (Mowery et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2012; Zhang and Alloway 2004), a small piece of window screen was attached to the tip of the galvanometer's ink pen, and this was positioned so that the whiskers, clipped to a length of 20 mm, protruded through the screen openings by 8–12 mm. Timed output from a digital waveform generator (ArbStudio; LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY) was used to control galvanometer movements. Each trial contained a sequence of twelve 50-ms triangular stimuli so that blocks of four stimuli were presented at a rate of 2, 5, and 8 Hz. The first stimulus in each block of four was classified as ≤1 Hz (i.e., less than or equal to 1 Hz) because it was preceded by an interval of 1 s or more in which no stimulus was administered. For each 50-ms stimulus, the whiskers were initially deflected in the caudal direction (∼1.5 mm) during the first 25-ms period, and then they returned to the original resting position over the next 25-ms period.Animals.This study used male Sprague-Dawley rats ranging from 300 to 500 g. All procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by Penn State's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Surgeries.Each rat was injected intramuscularly (IM) with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg).

Stereotaxic coordinates for the craniotomies were measured with respect to bregma: 1.2 mm lateral and 4.1 mm caudal for Pf, 2.6 mm lateral and 3.8 mm caudal for the posterior POm, and 2.0 mm lateral and 6.5 mm caudal for the superior colliculus.Dental cement was applied over the screws inserted in the occipital ridge, and two inverted bolts were inserted into the cement. After the cement cured, a goose-neck manipulator was fastened to each bolt. Stereotaxic ear bars were then removed to eliminate nociceptive inputs from the soft tissue in the auditory meatus.A SciWorks data acquisition system (version 6.0; DataWave Technologies, Broomfield, CO) displayed ECoG recordings continuously to indicate the anesthetic state of the rat (Friedberg et al. 1999).
